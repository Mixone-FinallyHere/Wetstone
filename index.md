Wetstone is a plugin API for creating mods for [V Rising](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/). If you are a mod developer, using Wetstone allows you to take advantage of tools like hot reloading, easy hooks and extensions, and user-friendly configuration.

If you are a **player**, this page is not for you. This documentation is only for mod developers. If some mod requires Wetstone, please [download it from Thunderstore](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/molenzwiebel/Wetstone).

If you are a **mod developer**, review the documentation on this site for information on how to add Wetstone to your mod, and how to use its features.

If you run into trouble, feel free to reach out to @molenzwiebel#2773 in the [V Rising Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/MB7U4Qrkbw).
